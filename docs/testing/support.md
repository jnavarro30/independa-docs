## Introduction

Support-related flows (e.g., login issues, password recovery, FAQs) are critical because they directly affect the user’s ability to access the application. This strategy defines how to test these flows to reduce support calls and ensure a smooth user experience.

## Objectives

- Verify that common self-service support features (login recovery, password reset, FAQs) function correctly.

- Ensure users can resolve common issues without needing live support.

- Provide high test coverage on these flows across web (Playwright) and mobile (Appium).

## In-Scope Scenarios
### Authentication & Login Issues

- Valid login with correct credentials.

- Invalid login attempts (wrong password, locked account, inactive user).

- Handling of error messages (clear, actionable).

- Retry and lockout policies (e.g., after 3 failed attempts).

### Forgot Password & Recovery

- Forgot password flow (request reset link).

- Email/SMS delivery of reset instructions.

- Reset password page:

- Expired token.

- Invalid/used token.

- Successful password update.

- Security requirements (e.g., minimum password strength).

### FAQs & Self-Help Content

- Accessing FAQs via app and web.

- Search and filtering functionality in FAQs.

- Verifying that FAQ links and help articles open correctly.

- Accessibility compliance (screen readers, font scaling).

### Error Handling & Edge Cases

- Network errors during login or password reset.

- Handling of delayed or missing reset emails.

- Graceful fallback when FAQ content service is unavailable.


## Test Approach
### Manual Testing

- Exploratory testing for usability and clarity of support flows (e.g., “Is the error message clear?”).

- Accessibility checks on FAQs and forms.

- Negative test cases (intentionally breaking flows to check resilience).

### Automated Testing

- Appium: Automate login, forgot password, and FAQ flows on mobile devices.

- Playwright: Automate the same flows for web, across browsers.

- Data-driven automation for multiple roles and scenarios (e.g., locked user, inactive account).

- Regression tests included in CI/CD to prevent recurring login/support bugs.

## Coverage & Metrics

- Functional Coverage: Each support flow (login, recovery, FAQ access).

- Error Coverage: Common failure scenarios simulated and verified.

- Platform Coverage:

    - Web: Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge (latest 2 versions).

    - Mobile: Latest iOS and Android, plus one legacy version.

- Success Criteria:

    - ≥ 95% of support-related test cases pass before release.

    - 0 high-severity open defects in login or password reset flows.

## Exit Criteria

- All major support-related workflows verified on target devices and browsers.

- Regression suite (Appium + Playwright) passes with no blockers.

- FAQs tested for availability, search functionality, and accessibility.

## Deliverables

- Test cases for login, recovery, and FAQ workflows.

- Automated regression suite results.

- Exploratory testing reports for usability and error handling.

- Defect reports and resolutions.
