## Introduction

This document outlines the software testing strategy for ensuring high-quality delivery of the application across devices. Both manual and automated testing will be applied to maximize coverage, efficiency, and defect detection.

## Objectives

- Ensure high-quality user experience across the chrome browser and tv devices.

- Achieve broad functional coverage through automation and deep exploratory coverage via manual testing.

- Detect defects early through shift-left practices and continuous testing.

- Support scalability by enabling data-driven, repeatable, and maintainable test suites.

## Scope
#### In-Scope

- Functional testing (unit, integration, end-to-end).

- Regression and smoke testing.

- Chrome browser & cross-device (tv) testing.

- Exploratory testing (usability, accessibility, error-handling).

#### Out-of-Scope

- Performance/stress testing (handled separately).

- Security penetration testing (separate team).

## Test Approach
#### Risk-Based Testing

- Prioritize testing of high-risk features (authentication, payments, caregiver-patient interactions).

- Automate high-value regression scenarios.

- Apply exploratory testing for high-risk edge cases.

#### Test Pyramid Strategy

- Unit Tests → Cover core logic, run on every commit.

- API/Integration Tests → Validate service contracts and error handling.

- UI Tests (Appium/Playwright) → Automate critical happy paths and smoke tests.

- Manual Testing → Exploratory testing, usability, accessibility, rare edge cases.

#### Scenario-Based Testing

- Focus on end-to-end user workflows (e.g., login → complete action → validate result).

- Use BDD-style scenarios that can be run manually or automated.

#### Data-Driven Testing

- Automate tests using parameterized datasets (roles, input variations).

- Test using Multiple Accounts (Empty and Populated for Manager, CR and at least 1 Contact)

- Reuse data pools for manual and automated test execution.

#### Exploratory Testing

- Use session-based charters (time-boxed sessions).

- Target areas automation cannot cover (UI/UX, accessibility, unexpected flows).

## Test Coverage

#### Coverage measured by:

- Requirements Coverage (traceability matrix).

- Code Coverage (unit + integration).

- Risk Coverage (high, medium, low risk areas).

- Device/Browser Coverage (matrix defined per release).

## Test Execution Strategy
#### Manual Testing

- Exploratory testing of new features.

- Usability and accessibility validation.

- Rare or complex edge cases.

#### Automated Testing

- Playwright: Chrome browser regression, smoke tests, and workflow automation.

- Data-driven suites for repeatable test coverage.

- Nightly CI/CD regression runs + smoke tests on each pull request.

## Test Environments

- Staging environment mirrors production setup for final validation.

- CI/CD pipeline triggers automated suites on dev/stage builds.

- Device/browser coverage includes:

    <!-- - Mobile: Latest Android/iOS, plus one legacy OS version. -->

    - Web: Chrome.

## Exit Criteria

- All critical & high-severity defects resolved or mitigated.

- ≥ 90% test case execution across planned scope.

- ≥ 80% code coverage for unit tests.

- Smoke suite passes consistently in CI/CD.

- Stakeholder sign-off after exploratory sessions.

## Deliverables

- Test cases (manual + automated).

- Test execution reports.

- Defect reports & root cause analysis.

- Automation results integrated into CI/CD dashboard.

## Roles & Responsibilities

- QA Engineers → Test design, automation, exploratory testing.

- Developers → Unit tests, CI/CD integration.

- Test Lead → Test planning, risk assessment, reporting.

- Product Owners → Acceptance criteria validation, sign-off.
